# Duplicacy-FastCDC
This repo is based on [duplicacy](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy), and we implement the FastCDC algorithm instead of original split method. We achieve higher speed with FastCDC algorithm.

The FastCDC origin paper is [here](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc16/technical-sessions/presentation/xia)
